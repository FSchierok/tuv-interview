            \begin{itemize}
                \item{An encryption is only as private as the key used to encrypt it.}
                \item{HSMs provide a secure environment for key generation, storage and management.}
                \item{Using dedicated and specialized hardware has many advantages: \begin{itemize}
                    \item{Faster encryption/decryption}
                    \item{Better power efficiency}
                    \item{Fewer attack vectors}
                    \item{Less knowledge required to use them}
                \end{itemize}}

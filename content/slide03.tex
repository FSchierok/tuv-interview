        The industry is secretive about the exact details of their HSMs, but some common features are:
            \begin{description}
                \item[Secure key storage:] A taper resistant storage for keys. Only the HSM can access it.
                \item[True random number generators:] A source of true randomness for key generation.
                \item[Secure execution environment:] The brain of the HSM, where all the math happens.
                \item[Physical security:] A suite of physical security measures to prevent tampering, for example temperature sensors or vibration sensors.
                \item[Secure communication:] A secure channel to communicate with the HSM. It shields the HSM against some types of attacks, for example the heard-bleed exploit.
